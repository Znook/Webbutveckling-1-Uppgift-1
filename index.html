    <h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</h1>
    <p><i>by William Shakespeare</i></p>
    <p>
      Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate</strong>:<br />
      Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />
      And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>:
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />
      And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm’d</sub>,<br />
      And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br />
      By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimm’d:
    </p>
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br />
    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st, <br />
    Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade, <br />
    When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st, <br />
    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, <br />
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
